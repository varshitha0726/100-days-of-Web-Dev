    <p>
        Where did the handsome beloved go?<br />
        I wonder, where did that tall, shapely cypress tree go?<br /><br />
        
        He spread his light among us like a candle.<br />
        Where did he go? So strange, where did he go without me?<br /><br />
        
        All day long my heart trembles like a leaf.<br />
        All alone at midnight, where did that beloved go?<br /><br />
        
        Go to the road, and ask any passing traveler<br />
        That soul-stirring companion, where did he go?<br /><br />
        
        Go to the garden, and ask the gardener<br />
        That tall, shapely rose stem, where did he go?<br /><br />
        
        Go to the rooftop, and ask the watchman<br />
        That unique sultan, where did he go?<br /><br />
        
    </p>
